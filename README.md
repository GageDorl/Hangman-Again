# Hangman-Again

So for this game, you will start by running 'node index.js'
When you start it will automatically start with a random word from the list.
When you guess it will tell you if you are correct or incorrect. If you are incorrect it will take away a guess and show you're remaining number of incorrect guesses.
Once you have used all of your guesses it will tell you you've lost and end the game, you get 10 guesses per word, not overall.
If you get the word right it will tell you and the ask if you want to play again.
